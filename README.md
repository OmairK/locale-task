### Write Buffer

### Implementation details
This API will be tested at peak times of the day when there are write requests incoming, so the primary objective here was to ease the load  database as the Postgresql server would be the first bottleneck here. For that a redis write-buffer is implemented that will store the validated data into redis, [Redisâ€™s Reliable Queue](https://redis.io/commands/rpoplpush#pattern-reliable-queue) pattern. A celery scheduler will then pop <user_defined_value> of elements from  redis and write it onto the Postgresql database via a bulk insert operation, which will be much faster than a single writes hence reducing the load on the database.

### Settings up
